-- 0129: Explicit is_new_hire flag on organization_invites
--
-- Both hire_to_onboarding (Knowledge Hub welcome content) and
-- hire_to_probation used to fire for EVERY invite-based join — someone
-- directly added on the Employees page got treated identically to someone
-- who actually came through the Hiring pipeline. Fine for the welcome
-- content (harmless either way), wrong for probation: an admin bulk-adding
-- existing staff to get them onto the platform would spin up a probation
-- review for every single one of them.
--
-- Per the CEO: keep welcome broad (unchanged), but probation should only
-- auto-start when there's a real signal this is a genuine new hire — either
-- (a) they came through the Hiring pipeline (candidate_id already implies
-- this), or (b) the admin explicitly marks them as one when inviting
-- directly. Default false everywhere so the safe/quiet behavior — no
-- probation review — is what happens unless someone opts in.
